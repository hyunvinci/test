 Codevember #1/ 2018. No clue if anyone else is till doing this, or how long I can keep doing it. Pure CSS 1 element loader. If you like my work in general and this demo in particular and you wish me to be able to continue putting out stuff, please consider one of the following:

* being a cool cat 😺 and becoming a patron on Patreon
